jp_matlab is a collection of helper scripts that I have written over the
past few years. I hope they are helpful, but use at your own risk!

In many cases the script will work on one sound file, stimulus, or
directory, and some additional scripting will be needed to process all
of the items you want to process for a particular project. I have tried
to include *_wrapper.m scripts as examples for just this purpose.

These scripts are provided under an MIT license (see LICENSE.txt).

Please contact me if you find any errors!
